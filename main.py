    üìû [CRM Call Audit Evaluation Prompt ‚Äì First-Time Inquiry Call]

    You are a senior customer experience auditor reviewing how a CRM executive handled a first-time inquiry call. Analyze this transcript:

    {transcript}

    Your job is to assess:

    1. What kind of customer this was (e.g., Price-sensitive, Confused, Serious buyer, Skeptical, Just Exploring)
    2. Whether the CRM delivered a confident, informative pitch.
    3. If all the customer's questions and objections were handled properly.
    4. Whether the lead was moved forward effectively.

    --- 

    1. **Customer Type & Intent:**
       - What kind of customer was this? What clues (words, tone, objections) helped you identify this?

    2. **Call Opening & Tone Matching:**
       - Did the CRM greet the customer professionally and with warmth?
       - Was the CRM's tone confident, friendly, and aligned with the customer‚Äôs energy?
       - Did the CRM actively listen and allow the client to speak without interruption? 
       - Score: __/10

    3. **CRM Pitch & Communication Quality:**
       - Did the CRM ask the right qualifying questions?
       - Was the brand/service introduced clearly?
       - Were key USPs conveyed? (customization, natural look, celebrity clientele, etc.)
       - Did the CRM guide the customer toward a consultation or next step?
       - Score: __/10

    4. **Customer Questions & Objection Handling:**
       - What were the main questions or concerns raised by the customer?
       - Did the CRM address all queries properly?
       - Were objections (price, maintenance, surgery fear, etc.) handled confidently?
       - Score: __/10

    5. **Missed Opportunities or Gaps:**
       - What information was left out or under-explained?
       - Did the CRM miss any chance to build trust, share a testimonial, or clarify a next step?

    6. **Call Outcome:**
       - Was a consultation booked? If not, was the next step explained clearly (follow-up, visit, etc.)? 
       - Was a follow-up planned?
       - ‚úî Call Status: Booked / Follow-up / Undecided / Not Interested

    7. **Customer Tag (Pick One):**
       üîò Price-sensitive
       üîò Confused / Over-researching
       üîò Serious Buyer
       üîò Just Exploring
       üîò Referral / Follower
       üîò Skeptical / Fearful

    8. **Action Required (Pick One):**
       üîò No Action ‚Äì Call handled well
       üîò Minor Feedback ‚Äì Needs polishing
       üîò Coaching Required ‚Äì Moderate gaps in handling
       üîò Retraining Needed ‚Äì Major pitch or process issues
       üîò Escalate ‚Äì Serious concern or customer mishandling

    --- 

    ‚úÖ **Final Verdict & Recommendation:**
       - Was the call handled effectively? What should be the immediate next step (for the CRM or the lead)?
